Example of using pipeline 3 (LLM end-to-end) where we process a message only using an LLM, which includes sending
all scene metadata in a prompt for parsing. This example showcases all five prompts used in out algorithm, with the
final prompt in step 4b being the heaviest prompt, only required if we don't have a perfect match when searching by
names only.

Example user command (utterance):   "The blue office desk"

Algorithm Steps:
    1. A prompt is sent to LLM to check if there's any spatial relationships between objects
    2. A prompt is sent to LLM to parse out all objects and attributes mentioned in the command
    3. A prompt is sent to LLM to parse out all the main object of interest
    4a. A prompt is sent to LLM with all names+uuids of scene objects to match with main object
        If there's no exact match then:
    4b. A prompt is sent to LLM with all descriptsion+uuids of scene objects to match with main object

    All possible matches are returned

Below is this the log of messages from this process, including the LLM prompts
In this case the algorithm successfully finds all seven blue office desks. This is an ambiguous command as there are
 multiple instances of blue office desks.

STEP 1 --> A prompt is sent to LLM to check if there's any spatial relationships between objects
===================================================================================================================
You are an API-style assistant.
Return **one valid JSON object** with a top-level key "relationships" whose value is an array of objects, each
containing: "main_object", "spatial_relation", "related_object".
If any of the relations are between an object and the user, label the related object as "*user".
If the relational phrase refers to an object's position within a group of the same object types (e.g., ordinal: "second picture", or extremal: "middle picture", "leftmost cup"), then ignore this spatial relationship, as it describes intra-category positioning rather than a spatial relationship between distinct objects. However, if the relational word is with respect to a different object, then include it (ie: "Bottle furthest from the sink" has a relation 'furthest from')

### Examples
User: "Select the stapler on the wooden table"
Assistant:
{
  "relationships": [
    {"main_object": "stapler", "spatial_relation": "on", "related_object": "wooden table"}
  ]
}

User: "Select the dim light directly above where I'm standing"
Assistant:
{
  "relationships": [
    {"main_object": "light", "spatial_relation": "above", "related_object": "*user"}
  ]
}

User: "Select the blue office desk closest to the door beside the posters on the wall"
Assistant:
{
  "relationships": [
    {"main_object": "blue office desk", "spatial_relation": "closest to", "related_object": "door"},
    {"main_object": "door", "spatial_relation": "beside", "related_object": "posters"},
    {"main_object": "posters", "spatial_relation": "on", "related_object": "wall"}
  ]
}

Note that some relationships may be implied based on the context such as the following example
User: "On the tree in the garden, select the apple on the broken branch"
Assistant:
{
  "relationships": [
    {"main_object": "apple", "spatial_relation": "on", "related_object": "broken branch"},
    {"main_object": "broken branch", "spatial_relation": "on", "related_object": "tree"},
    {"main_object": "tree", "spatial_relation": "in", "related_object": "garden"}
  ]
}

Note that the word 'with' might not indicate a second object, but rather an additional descriptor of an object. In the following example we can consider the Nvidia graphics card to be an additional description of the laptop.
User: "Select the silver laptop with a Nvidia graphics card"
Assistant:
{
  "relationships": []
}

User: "Select the red magnet"
Assistant:
{ "relationships": [] }

User: "Select the book on top of the shelf"
Assistant:
{
  "relationships": [
    {"main_object": "book", "spatial_relation": "atop", "related_object": "shelf"}
  ]
}

Note that 'of' is not a spatial relationship token when used alone.
User: "Select the knight of the queen"
Assistant:
{
  "relationships": []
}

User: "What time is it?"
Assistant:
{ "relationships": [] }

===================================================================================================================
STEP 2 --> A prompt is sent to LLM to parse out all objects and attributes mentioned in the command
===================================================================================================================
You are an API-style assistant.
Return **one valid JSON object** with a top-level key "objects".
Each item in that array has:
  • "object_text"  – full phrase as spoken/written by user. If there's no definitive object name, then this is the description of the object.
  • "head"         – the head noun or named entity (default to named entity if it exists).  If the user only describes the object, without giving a specific name, and you can not determine the name based on the provided named entities, then use the name 'none' and give one summarized descriptor.
  • "descriptors"  – list of modifier words (can be empty). Only include adjectival modifiers, superlative references, or ordinal numeral modifiers. Simplify compound or verbose modifiers when possible (e.g. "bottle with nothing in it" → "emtpy bottle", "box with no label" → "unlabeled box").

### Examples
User: "Select the largest shiny blue pot on top of the wooden table in the kitchen. The pot that is furthest on the left"
Assistant:
{
  "objects": [
    {"object_text": "largest shiny blue pot", "head": "pot", "descriptors": ["largest","shiny","blue", "furthest left"]},
    {"object_text": "wooden table", "head": "table", "descriptors": ["wooden"]},
    {"object_text": "kitchen", "head": "kitchen", "descriptors": []}
  ]
}

User: "The dirty bowl that you left in the sink. Not the brown bowl, the white one."

{
  "objects": [
    {"object_text": "dirty white bowl", "head": "bowl", "descriptors": ["dirty","white"]},
    {"object_text": "brown bowl", "head": "bowl", "descriptors": ["brown"]},
    {"object_text": "sink", "head": "sink", "descriptors": []}
  ]
}

User: "The thing that I eat soup out of. Not the brown bowl, the white one."
Assistant:

    {"object_text": "the desk", "head": "desk", "descriptors": []},
    {"object_text": "the wall shelves", "head": "shelves", "descriptors": []}
  ]
}

Note that some relationships are between the same type of object
User: "Select the bottle furthest on the right"

User: "What time is it?"
Assistant:
{ "objects": [] }

STEP 2 --> JSON response from LLM
===================================================================================================================
{
  "objects": [
    {"object_text": "the blue office desk", "head": "office desk", "descriptors": ["blue"]}
  ]
}



===================================================================================================================
STEP 3 --> A prompt is sent to LLM to parse out all the main object of interest
===================================================================================================================
You are an API-style assistant.
Return **one valid JSON object** with a top-level key "mainObj".
The value of "mainObj" is itself an object with:
  • "main_object"  – the head noun or named entity. If the user only describes the object, without giving a specific name, and you can not determine the name based on the provided text, then use the name 'none' and have one long descriptor.
  • "descriptors"  – list of modifiers (may be empty). Only include adjectival modifiers, superlative references, or ordinal numeral modifiers. Simplify compound or verbose modifiers when possible (e.g. "bottle with nothing in it" → "emtpy bottle", "box with no label" → "unlabeled box").

Assistant:
{
  "mainObj": {
    "main_object": "box", "descriptors": ["little", "black", "furthest left"]
  }
}

User: "Pick up the book on the shelf in the other room"
Assistant:

  "mainObj": {
    "main_object": "book", "descriptors": []
  }
}

User: "Where's the thing I lost last week. The tape measure. I left it in the workshop. You know, the yellow and black one?"
Assistant:
{
  "mainObj": {
    "main_object": "tape measure", "descriptors": ["yellow","black"]
  }
}

User: "Where's the thing I lost last week. It's used for determining the dimensions of things. I left it in the workshop. You know, the yellow and black thing?"
Assistant:
{
  "mainObj": {
    "main_object": "none", "descriptors": ["yellow and black thing used for determining dimensions that was lost last week in the workshop"]
  }
}

User: "What time is it?"
Assistant:
{
  "mainObj": {
    "main_object": "none", "descriptors": []
  }
}


===================================================================================================================
STEP 3 --> JSON response from LLM
===================================================================================================================
{
  "mainObj": {
    "main_object": "office desk",
    "descriptors": ["blue"]
  }
}



===================================================================================================================
STEP 4a --> A prompt is sent to LLM with all names+uuids of scene objects to match with main object
===================================================================================================================
You are an API-style assistant.
Return **one valid JSON object** whose single top-level key is "object_matches".

Each element of "object_matches" must be an object with **exactly**:
  • "id"          – the unique object ID corresponding to the matching text

Rules:
1. Only include IDs that appear in the scene inventory.
2. A match is **case-insensitive semantic equivalence** (e.g. "macbook pro" ⟶ "laptop").
3. If nothing matches, respond with an empty list: {"object_matches": []}
4. Return ALL possible matches.
5. Return no additional keys, comments, or trailing commas.

### Format Examples
Example 'Scene inventory':
000001: apple laptop
000002: apple laptop
000003: MacBook Pro
000004: standing desk
000005: Dell Computer
Example 'Main object of interest':
"computer"
Example 'User command':
"Select the silver computer on the desk in the hallway."

Assistant:
{
  "object_matches":[
    {"id":"000001"},
    {"id":"000002"},
    {"id":"000003"},
    {"id":"000005"}

===================================================================================================================
STEP 4b --> A prompt is sent to LLM with all descriptsion+uuids of scene objects to match with main object
===================================================================================================================
You are an API-style assistant.
Return **one valid JSON object** whose single top-level key is "object_matches".

Each element of "object_matches" must be an object with **exactly**:
  • "id" – the unique object ID that best matches the user's target description

Matching logic
1. Only include IDs that appear in the scene inventory.
2. A match is a **case-insensitive semantic description overlap**.
   – Look at the *meaning* of the main object phrase and the natural-language descriptions.
   - If main object is 'none' you must determine the description of the object of main focus in the users command. Ignore all other objects.
   – Synonyms, hypernyms, colour/shape/material/function cues, and brand/model hints all count.
3. If multiple items plausibly match, include **all**; otherwise include the best item(s).
4. Begin with a broad set of plausible candidates, eliminating only clear mismatches at first. Then, iteratively refine the candidate list by applying increasingly specific semantic, functional, or contextual constraints from the user input. Do not attempt to find the perfect match in a single pass — favor a step-by-step narrowing strategy.
5. If you find no matches do one final check based on deep reasoing (e.g. User command: "I want out of here"  could match with text describing a door)
5. If *nothing* plausibly matches, respond with an empty list: {"object_matches": []}
6. Return no additional keys, comments, or trailing commas.
